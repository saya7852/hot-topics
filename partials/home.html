    <p>How often have you willingly sacrificed your free time to make more money? You're not alone. But new research suggests that prioritizing money over time may actually undermine our happiness. <br>In a recent study, more than 1,000 students graduating from the University of British Columbia completed an assessment measuring whether they tend to value time over money or money over time. The majority of students reported prioritizing time — but not by much. Nearly 40% reported prioritizing money. <br>To find out how this choice correlated with their cognitive and emotional well-being, the students' level of happiness was measured both prior to graduation and a year down the line.  Among other measures, they were asked to report on their life satisfaction by answering the question, “Taking all things together, how happy would you say you are?” on a scale from 0-10, with 0 = not at all and 10 = extremely. <br>The researchers found that the students who prioritized money ended up less happy a year after graduation, compared to their classmates who chose to prioritize time. The results remained the same even after controlling for their happiness before graduation and accounting for their various socioeconomic backgrounds.<br><br><a class="a-link" href="https://hbr.org/2020/09/does-more-money-really-makes-us-more-happy">Read More: Harvard Business Review</a></p>

    <p>GMOs are relatively new and, like anything new, there are conflicting viewpoints about manyissues surrounding the use of these plants. One area that draws a lot of attention is whetherthese GMO plants and the foods that contain them are safe to eat. There is no data toindicate that consumption of GMOs is bad for human health.<br>How do we know? GMOs have undergone more detailed evaluation than any other group ofplants that we consume. In almost all cases, GMOs diff er from a conventional plant by theaddition of just one or two genes that produce one or two new proteins. The origin andfunction of these proteins are well understood. For example, the proteins are studied tomake sure they do not have any characteristics that are likely to cause allergic reactions. TheNational Academy for Science, the United States' number one source for independent,objective advice to the nation on matters of science and technology, concluded that GMOsare safe for human health. The same conclusion has been reached by a large number ofprestigious health and science organizations from around the world. In addition, over thetwo decades that GMOs have been on the market, there have been no occurrences of healthissues due to genetically modified organisms.<br>As GMOs stand today, there are no health benefits to eating them over non-GMO foods.However, this may change in the future as technology develops and becomes moresophisticated.<br><br><a class="a-link" href="https://ag.purdue.edu/GMOs/Pages/WhatareGMOs.aspx">Read More: Purdue University, College of Agriculture</a></p>

    <p>How many people will be born in the future? <br>We don't know. But we know one thing: The future is immense, the universe will exist for trillions of years. <br>We can use this fact to get a sense of how many descendants we might have in that vast future ahead.The number of future people depends on the size of the population at any point in time and how long each of them will live. But the most important factor will be how long humanity will exist. <br>Before we look at a range of very different potential futures, let's start with a simple baseline.We are mammals. One way to think about how long we might survive is to ask how long other mammals survive. It turns out that the lifespan of a typical mammalian species is about 1 million years. Let's think about a future in which humanity exists for 1 million years: 200,000 years are already behind us, so there would be 800,000 years still ahead. Let's consider a scenario in which the population stabilizes at 11 billion people (based on the UN projections for the end of this century) and in which the average life length rises to 88 years.<br> In such a future, there would be 100 trillion people alive over the next 800,000 years. <br><br><a class="a-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/longtermism">Read More: Our World In Data</a></p>
